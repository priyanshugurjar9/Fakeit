# RUMOUR DETECTION MODEL
A Rumour Detection Model is an artificial intelligence system designed to identify, analyze, and classify information as either factual or potentially false. It is commonly used to monitor social media posts, news articles, forums, and online conversations where misinformation can spread rapidly.
Using GOOGLE- GENERATIVE AI (Genai) and machine learning, the model evaluates:

The linguistic patterns of the text (tone, sentiment, keywords)

The context in which the information appears

Credibility of sources and cross-referencing with verified databases

This model helps in:

Preventing the spread of fake news

Maintaining trust in digital platforms

Assisting journalists, moderators, and fact-checkers in real time

Rumour detection systems are crucial in todayâ€™s digital age where false claims can trigger social panic, political unrest, or economic disruptions. By spotting rumours early, these models support informed decisions and healthy public discourse.
